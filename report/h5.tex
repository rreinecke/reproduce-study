All answers (without don't know) -  Mean workflow: 4.400000, code documentation : 4.449799, code complexity: 3.874494, input data not available: 4.505837, code availability: 4.503906, written language: 3.481633

Thus, the main reason for a lack of reproducibility is: Input data, then 2: code availability, 3: documentation, 4: workflow, 5: code complexity, 6: language
