All answers (without don't know) -  Mean workflow: 4.390438, code documentation : 4.440816, code complexity: 3.884774, input data not available: 4.501976, code availability: 4.500000, written language: 3.473029

Thus, the main reason for a lack of reproducibility is: Input data, then 2: code availability, 3: documentation, 4: workflow, 5: code complexity, 6: language
